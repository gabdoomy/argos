# Argos Take-home project
<!-- ðŸŽ‰  First of all we at Argos would like to congratulate you for getting this far! ðŸŽ‰  -->

We gave one of our Java graduate developer, a task of creating a Search page ðŸ˜‚. 

However we think that the project could be improved. 

Your task, if you choose to accept, is to fix and improve the user experience and user interface of the Search page.

## Getting Started
To complete this task, you'll need:
  * Node : [Nodejs Website](https://nodejs.org/en/) Ideally v8.4.0 or above

* We've added an `.nvmrc` file to help with versions if you have problems. [Node version manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To install all the Nodejs packages, which are required, you'll need to run:
```
  npm install
```

In the root of the project directory.


## Running the project:
Running the project is simple, all you need to do is run these two commands on two seperate command line interfaces (maybe this is something that could be improved? ðŸ˜‰)

  ```
    npm run watcher
  ```

  ```
    npm run server
  ```

  That should bundle the project and start the server.

  * Client:
  http://localhost:8080/ 
  
  * Server: 
  http://localhost:8080/api/data
